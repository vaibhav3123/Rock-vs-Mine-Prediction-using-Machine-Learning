# 🧠 Rock vs Mine Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a **binary classification model** to predict whether a sonar signal is reflected from a **rock** or a **mine**, using frequency-based data and a Logistic Regression model.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- The dataset consists of 208 samples with 60 numerical features.
- Each instance represents sonar signal returns.
- Target Labels:  
  - `R` → Rock  
  - `M` → Mine

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection and Exploration**
   - Loaded and reviewed the dataset
   - Analyzed structure and statistical summary

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Separated features and labels
   - Performed train-test split (15% test size)

3. **Model Building**
   - Trained a Logistic Regression classifier

4. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluated accuracy on training and test data
   - Developed a custom input prediction system
